This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing array elements outside their valid index range.  Ada uses 1-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 1, not 0. The original code attempts to access `My_Arr(I - 1)` within a loop iterating from `My_Arr'Range`, causing an attempt to access index 0, resulting in a runtime exception.  The solution shows the correct way to iterate through the array.
